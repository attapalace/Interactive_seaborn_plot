# Interactive_seaborn_plot
Making an interactive plot using Matplotlib, seaborn and ipywidgets library

In this simple project i used ipywidgets to add dropdown menu to choose the desired PHD field, check buttons to filter by males or females, toggle buttons to change the order of the results, to change the plot as needed
